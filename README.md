# Kralı Bul (Find the King)

This repository contains a small Python game with a Tkinter GUI. The goal is to find the hidden king tile on a 5x5 board using numbered cards. The rules can be customized or expanded later.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x with Tkinter support (usually comes pre‑installed on Windows and many Linux distributions).

## Running the Game

1. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Find-the-king.py
   ```

A window should open showing the board and card selection buttons.

## Notes

- The rules of the game can be updated in this README once finalized.
- The GUI lives in `Find-the-king.py` while the core logic is in
  `game_logic.py`.
